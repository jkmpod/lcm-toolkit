#### Learner Experience Interactions (LxIs)
Map objectives to discussion activities:

| Learning Objective | Focus Question | Expected Learning | Assessment Method |
|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
|                   |                |                   |                  |

#### Learning Extension Trajectories (LxTs)
Map objectives to additional resources:

| Learning Objective | Resource Type | Target Learner Level | Assimilation Check |
|-------------------|---------------|---------------------|-------------------|
|                   |               |                     |                  |
|                   |               |                     |                  |

### Part 4: Assessment Planning

1. Formative Assessment Alignment:
   - How will each objective be checked during learning?
     * Objective 1: _________________________________
     * Objective 2: _________________________________
     * Objective 3: _________________________________

2. Summative Assessment Alignment:
   - How will mastery be demonstrated?
     * Objective 1: _________________________________
     * Objective 2: _________________________________
     * Objective 3: _________________________________

### Part 5: Objective Validation Checklist

For each learning objective, verify:

- [ ] Is it Specific?
- [ ] Is it Measurable?
- [ ] Is it Achievable?
- [ ] Is it Relevant?
- [ ] Is it Time-bound?
- [ ] Does it align with learner needs?
- [ ] Can it be assessed effectively?
- [ ] Does it support course goals?

### Part 6: Differentiation Planning

How will objectives be adapted for:

1. Different Proficiency Levels:
   - Beginners: ____________________________________
   - Intermediate: _________________________________
   - Advanced: ____________________________________

2. Different Learning Styles:
   - Visual learners: ________________________________
   - Auditory learners: _____________________________
   - Kinesthetic learners: ___________________________

### Part 7: Reflection Questions
