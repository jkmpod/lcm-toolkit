# Learner-Centric MOOC Toolkit

A comprehensive toolkit for designing and implementing learner-centric Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) using the LCM (Learner-Centric MOOC) framework.

Note: All the documents in this repository have been created with the help of AI (Claude Sonnet 3.5) using prompts. Please refer to the [AI Acknowledgement](./AI-ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.md) section to get the details of contributions made by AI and the human effort in the process.

## Overview

This toolkit provides resources, templates, and guides for educators looking to create engaging and effective online courses using learner-centric principles. It's based on the LCM framework which consists of four key components:

- **Learning Dialogues (LeDs)**: Interactive content delivery with embedded reflection points
- **Learning by Doing (LbDs)**: Practice activities with constructive feedback
- **Learner Experience Interactions (LxIs)**: Focused discussions and peer learning
- **Learning Extension Trajectories (LxTs)**: Curated resources for diverse learning paths

## Getting Started

1. Start with the [Introduction to LCM Framework](docs/lcm-framework.md)
2. Review the [Getting Started Guide](docs/getting-started.md)
3. Explore the [Templates](templates/) directory for planning worksheets
4. Check out [Example Courses](examples/) for implementation ideas
