## Initial Repository Structure

**Prompt:**

I am planning to create a 1-day workshop on Learner-centric MOOC creation to a set of teachers. For this I need to create a new content outline.

The broad idea is to provide teachers with two choices:

2. They can take an existing MOOC and augment the content by bringing in local language expertise
