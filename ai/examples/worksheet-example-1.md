## Final Worksheet Content

### Effective Peer Feedback Worksheet

#### Part 1: Understanding Peer Feedback
1. What makes feedback effective? (Reflection)
   - Think about feedback you've received:
     * What made it helpful?
     * What made it challenging?
     * How did you apply it?

2. Key Principles of Effective Feedback
   - Specific
   - Actionable
   - Balanced
   - Respectful

#### Part 2: Giving Feedback

**Structure Template:**
1. Positive aspects
   - "I found ___ particularly effective because ___"
   - "The ___ shows strong understanding of ___"

2. Areas for improvement
   - "Consider enhancing ___ by ___"
   - "You might strengthen ___ through ___"

3. Specific suggestions
   - "One approach could be ___"
   - "Have you considered ___?"

**Practice Scenarios:**
1. Code Review Example:
```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total/len(numbers)
```

2. Data Analysis Example:
```
Project presents visualization of sales data but lacks explanation of trends
```

#### Part 3: Receiving Feedback

**Reflection Questions:**
1. What is your initial reaction to the feedback?
2. Which suggestions seem most valuable?
3. How might you implement the suggestions?

**Action Planning:**
- Priority improvements: _______________
- Implementation steps: _______________
- Timeline: _______________
