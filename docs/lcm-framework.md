**Key Features:**
- Immediate application activities
- Customized feedback
- Multiple practice opportunities
- Clear success criteria

**Implementation Guidelines:**
- Align activities with learning objectives
- Design specific, actionable feedback
- Include both simple and complex tasks
- Support peer assessment for larger tasks

### 3. Learner Experience Interactions (LxIs)
**Purpose:** Cultivate peer learning through focused discussion

**Key Features:**
- Structured discussion prompts
- Peer learning opportunities
- Reflection quizzes
- Community building

**Implementation Guidelines:**
- Create engaging discussion topics
- Guide productive interactions
- Monitor and moderate effectively
- Use reflection quizzes to incentivize participation

### 4. Learning Extension Trajectories (LxTs)
**Purpose:** Support diverse learning paths and interests

**Key Features:**
- Curated additional resources
- Multiple learning paths
- Assimilation quizzes
- Flexible progression options

**Implementation Guidelines:**
- Provide varied resource types
- Consider different learning levels
- Create meaningful assimilation checks
- Support self-directed learning
