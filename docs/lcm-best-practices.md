# Best Practices Guide for Learner-Centric MOOC Design

## Learning Dialogues (LeDs)

### Video Creation Best Practices
- Keep videos short and focused (typically 6-10 minutes)
- Maintain eye contact with the camera to establish connection
- Speak at a moderate pace with clear pronunciation
- Use conversational tone while maintaining professionalism
- Test audio quality before recording
- Avoid busy or distracting backgrounds
- Consider using picture-in-picture format with slides as the main view

### Reflection Spot Design
- Place reflection spots at natural pause points in content
- Design questions that encourage critical thinking, not just recall
- Anticipate common learner responses and prepare follow-up content
- Use reflection spots to transition between concepts
- Keep reflection activities brief but meaningful
- Provide clear instructions for learner responses

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't create long, uninterrupted content segments
- Avoid using reflection spots just for attendance/engagement
- Don't ignore learner responses in subsequent content
- Avoid technical jargon without proper context

## Learning by Doing (LbDs)

### Activity Design
- Align activities directly with learning objectives
- Create opportunities for immediate application of concepts
- Design activities with increasing complexity levels
- Include both individual and collaborative activities
- Provide clear instructions and success criteria
- Consider time requirements for completion

### Feedback Design
- Provide specific, constructive feedback for each response
- Include both what was wrong and how to improve
- Design feedback that guides learners to correct understanding
- Consider common misconceptions in feedback design
- Make feedback actionable and encouraging

### Assessment Strategies
- Use multiple formats (MCQs, open-ended questions, projects)
- Include both formative and summative assessments
- Design rubrics for complex assignments
- Implement peer assessment for larger assignments
- Provide sample responses or exemplars

## Learner Experience Interactions (LxIs)

### Discussion Design
- Create focused questions that encourage multiple viewpoints
- Set clear expectations for participation
- Design questions that build on course content
- Include real-world applications or scenarios
- Plan for scalable interaction patterns

### Moderation Strategies
- Establish clear discussion guidelines
- Monitor discussions regularly
- Intervene strategically to guide discussion
- Encourage peer-to-peer interaction
- Summarize key points periodically

### Reflection Quiz Design
- Base questions on discussion content
- Encourage review of peer contributions
- Focus on key learning points
- Keep quizzes brief but meaningful

## Learning Extension Trajectories (LxTs)

### Resource Curation
- Verify resource accessibility and relevance
- Include multiple formats (text, video, interactive)
- Consider different learning levels and styles
- Ensure resources align with learning objectives
- Include both foundational and advanced materials

### Assimilation Quiz Design
- Keep questions straightforward
- Focus on key concepts from resources
- Make completion achievable with reasonable effort
- Include variety in question types

### Supporting Diverse Learners
- Provide resources in multiple languages when possible
- Consider cultural contexts in resource selection
- Include both theoretical and practical resources
- Accommodate different learning preferences

## General Implementation Tips
