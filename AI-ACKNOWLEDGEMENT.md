# AI Assistance Acknowledgment

This repository was developed with assistance from Claude (Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet, October 2024 version), an AI language model. The AI helped in:

1. Structuring the repository layout
2. Creating initial documentation templates
3. Developing worksheets and guides
4. Providing framework explanations
5. Suggesting best practices

## Collaborative Process

The repository content was created through an iterative dialogue between human expertise in education and AI capabilities in content organization and documentation. All content was:
- Human-directed through specific prompts
- Reviewed and validated for accuracy
- Aligned with established educational principles
- Enhanced with practical teaching experience

## AI Configuration

The interaction was conducted with Claude 3.5 Sonnet with the following specifications:
- Model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
- Context: Education, MOOC design, and learner-centric principles
- Primary focus: Documentation and educational content creation
- Time period: February 2025

For transparency and reproducibility, the complete prompt history and configuration settings used in creating this repository are available in the [PROMPTS.md](PROMPTS.md) file.

## Usage Considerations

While AI was instrumental in organizing and documenting this framework, the core educational principles and pedagogical approaches are based on established research and practical experience in learner-centric MOOC design, particularly drawing from work at IIT Bombay.

Users of this repository should:
- Consider this documentation as a starting point
- Adapt materials to their specific contexts
- Contribute their own expertise and experiences
- Help improve and evolve the framework
